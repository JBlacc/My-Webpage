        <div class="description" > Hello everyone, I am Jeremy and am currently learning to write code.  I have spent the last 20 years working as a construction project manager and just recently decided to change careers.  I have been interested in the tech industry for many years and have decided to learn to code and become a web developer.  I am hoping the skills I learn with Andy will help me to achieve this goal.</div>
