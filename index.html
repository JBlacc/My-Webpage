          Hello everyone, I am Jeremy and am currently learning to write code. I
          have spent the last 20 years working as a construction project manager
          and just recently decided to change careers at the age of 45. I have
          been interested in the tech industry for many years but have always
          been too intimidated to take a chance. I finally decided to take the
          leap and learn to code and become a web developer. I am hoping the
          skills I learn with Andy will help me to achieve this goal. I am also
          an advocate of the pitbull breed and enjoy spreading postivity and
          truth about these loving animals.
